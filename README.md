Meteor Demo
==============================

This repository has materials for a hands-on tutorial to demonstrate tools developed by Red Hat's Artificial Intelligence Center of Excellence.

This tutorial highlights the capabilities of [Project Meteor](https://github.com/AICoE/meteor), which is a web application that converts users' GitHub repositories into both a [JupyterBook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) and an interactive web environment.
